# Real Estate Analysis with Web Scraping and Streamlit

## üí° Idea
The project idea is to extract data from a real estate website (Aqarmap), which is a website dedicated to real estate. The data is extracted using web scraping, then a transformation is performed on the data to make it clean and suitable for analysis. These preceding steps are called the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

## üìç Project Steps
- **Extracting Data**: Data is extracted from the Aqarmap website using web scraping.
- **Transformation**: Perform transformation on the data, such as changing column names, removing certain symbols from the data like '\n', converting data types to appropriate types, and formatting the data appropriately for analysis, etc.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the data to derive insights and create filters to be able to filter the data.
